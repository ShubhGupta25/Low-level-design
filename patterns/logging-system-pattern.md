# Logging System Pattern

## What is it?

A design approach for implementing logging in applications, often using patterns like Singleton, Proxy, or Observer.

## When to Use

- Need to track application events, errors, or performance
- Centralize logging logic

## How to Use

1. Create a logger class (often Singleton)
2. Expose logging methods
3. Use logger throughout the application

## Example (Java)

```java
class Logger {
    private static Logger instance = new Logger();
    private Logger() {}
    public static Logger getInstance() { return instance; }
    public void log(String msg) { System.out.println(msg); }
}
```

## Advantages

- Centralized logging
- Easy to manage and extend
- Can add features (file logging, remote logging)

## Disadvantages

- Singleton may limit flexibility
- Logging can impact performance
